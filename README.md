TestCafe Test Documentation
Test Objective
The purpose of this document is to provide detailed documentation for the TestCafe tests conducted to assess the user login functionality of the DeepThought Education platform.

Test Environment
- Test Automation Framework: TestCafe
- Application URL: https://dev.deepthought.education/login
- Browsers Tested: Google Chrome (version 116.0.0.0)
- Operating System: Windows 10

Test Cases
**Test Case 1: Successful Login**
*Description*: This test verifies that a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.
```javascript
await t
    .typeText('#username', 'charan4547')
    .typeText('#password', 'Charan@1')
    .click('#login');
```
*Expected Outcome*: The test expects the user to be logged in successfully.

**Test Case 2: Invalid Login**
*Description*: This test evaluates unsuccessful login attempts with invalid credentials.
```javascript
await t
    .typeText('#username', 'charan4547')
    .typeText('#password', 'Charan@13')
    .click('#login')
    .expect(Selector('#login-error-notify').exists).ok();
```
*Expected Outcome*: The test expects an error message to be displayed, indicating an unsuccessful login.

**Test Case 3: Error Messages for Invalid Login**
*Description*: This test validates that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid login attempts.
```javascript
await t
    .typeText('#username', 'charan4557')
    .typeText('#password', 'Charan@12')
    .click('#login')
    .expect(Selector('#login-error-notify').innerText).eql('Ã—\nLogin Unsuccessful\n\nInvalid login credentials');
```
*Expected Outcome*: The test expects the displayed error message to match the predefined error message.

**Test Case 4: Dashboard Redirection**
*Description*: This test checks if the user is redirected to the dashboard screen upon successful login.
```javascript
await t
    .typeText('#username', 'charan4547')
    .typeText('#password', 'Charan@1')
    .click('#login');
```
*Expected Outcome*: The test expects the user to be redirected to the dashboard screen.

Challenges Faced
1. *Selector Accuracy*: Initially, there were challenges in accurately selecting elements in the login form. Refinement of selectors was necessary to ensure precision.
2. *Handling Asynchronous Behavior*: Some test cases faced issues due to the application's asynchronous behavior. We implemented wait mechanisms to address these challenges.

Test Results
- Test Cases Passed: 4
- Test Cases Failed: 0

Conclusion
In this testing effort, all four test cases passed successfully. This validates the correct behavior of the DeepThought Education platform's login functionality. Challenges related to selector accuracy and asynchronous behavior were addressed, resulting in a stable testing outcome. Further testing and enhancements may be considered to ensure ongoing reliability.
